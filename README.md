# Node TypeScript Starter

This repository serves as a starter template for creating Node.js projects using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stavkamil/node-typescript-starter.git
cd node-typescript-starter
npm install
```

You can then run the project in development mode using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the project using `nodemon`, which will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the code.

To build the project for production, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will use `tsup` to compile the project and create CommonJS and ES Modules files as well as TypeScript declaration files.
